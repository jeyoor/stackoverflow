#Mobile App Logging

What approaches work best for logging or profiling mobile applications?

[Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6083203) and the [iOS App Store](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AnalyzingCrashReports/AnalyzingCrashReports.html) provide functionality for the developer to download crash reports for  published apps.

In addition, third-party service providers such as the tri-branded [Crashlytics](http://try.crashlytics.com/reports/)/[Fabric/Answers](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/overview.html) provide SDKs that can be installed for reporting additional data.

Also, it appears there are some [open-source solutions](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) that could be self-hosted.

How do these solutions work in practice? What problems or drawbacks do they carry?
